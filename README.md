# ChatGPT Calculator Integration

## Overview
This project demonstrates integrating a ChatGPT language model into a standard calculator interface. It combines hardware understanding, software programming, and AI interaction to create a compact, intelligent device. The goal was to explore how AI can operate within constrained hardware environments.

## Features
- **AI Interaction:** Users can ask questions or solve problems through the calculator interface.
- **Embedded Logic:** Efficient handling of inputs and responses to fit within calculator memory constraints.
- **Real-time Processing:** Immediate responses without external devices, demonstrating hardware-software integration.

## Technologies Used
- Python (or C/C++ depending on your implementation)
- ChatGPT API / Local model integration
- Calculator hardware (include exact model if applicable)
- Optional: Microcontroller interfacing or hardware modification

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/chatgpt-calculator.git
```

2. Install dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3. Run the program:
```bash
python main.py
```

## Usage
1. Power on the calculator (or connect your device).
2. Input your question or calculation.
3. Receive AI-assisted output directly on the calculator display.

## Learning Points
- Bridging software and hardware constraints
- Optimizing AI responses for small devices
- Practical experience with embedded systems and AI integration
